# Gloss_py 

These are the python bindings for Gloss

## Install gloss-py from source
This build and installs the package for local development from source. When building from source, you can also generates stubs for the python bindings. This is optional but highly recommended. This would let us see all methods under classes and function signatures in IDEs, making gloss easier to use.
